## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The emulator was not working at all for me. So I unfortunately had to go without it. I’ve re-downloaded the Android Studio several times, Cold Booted the emulator several times, all while having plenty of space (6.6 GB as Android Studio reported) on my device.(Various help sites said it may have been a storage space issue).I was stuck trying to troubleshoot this problem for 2 days with no luck. I reached out to Codepath with my issue and they replied that they received my message and are happy to help, but haven't responded with possible solutions yet. I also had to manually push my work to GitHub on the terminal because the tool extension VCS wouldn’t accept my credentials. Learning the layout of Android Studio was jarring at first, but I eventually got the hang of it thanks to the tutorial videos.
